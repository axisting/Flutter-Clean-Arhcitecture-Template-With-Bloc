## **Features:**

### Layered Architecture:

Presentation Layer (UI)
Business Layer (Application Logic)
Data Access Layer (Database and API interaction)

### Dependency Injection:

Easy testing and maintenance
Adaptability for different platforms

### Testing Support:

Unit and integration tests examples

### Examples:

User authentication
Local data storage
Data exchange with API

## **Getting Started:**

## **Note:**

This template is designed as a starting point. You may need to customize the template to meet the specific requirements of your application.
In Android studio, it can bring libraries without any problem with "flutter pub get". but with Vscode, l10n is a problem and if you first delete the l10n.yaml file and add it again after running the application, you will not have any problems.

## **Support:**

If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
